# Database-Intro

Integrating PostgreSQL with python. 

Nothing too complicated, just testing out a very basic integration of the two.

Notes: you will have to install the tabulate library if you want the output in table form. Trust me, it will be very ugly otherwise.

You can do so by using the following in the command line: pip install tabulate

If you are having trouble or simply do not want to download the library:

1: comment out the 'import tabulate' statement (line 2)

2: comment out the  #print using table statement (line 34)

3: uncomment the '#print without table' block of code. (lines 37-40)

If you rerun the code, you will have to uncomment line 16 because the table will already exist, and therefore line 17 will fail.
