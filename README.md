# Database-Intro

Integrating PostgreSQL with python. 
Nothing too complicated, just testing out a very basic integration of the two.

Note: you will have to install the tabulate library if you want the output in table form. 
You can do so by using the following in the command line: pip install tabulate

If you are having trouble or simply do not want to download the library, comment out the 'import tabulate' statement at the very top and the print satement. Then uncomment the '#print without table' block of code.
