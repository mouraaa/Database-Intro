# About
Nothing too complicated, just testing out a very basic integration of PostgreSQL with python

## Prerequisites 
you will have to install the tabulate library if you want the output in table form. Trust me, it will be very ugly otherwise.

` pip install tabulate `

If you are having trouble or simply do not want to download the library:

* comment out the 'import tabulate' statement (line 2)

* comment out the  #print_using_table statement (line 34)

* uncomment the '#print_without_table' block of code (lines 37-40)

## ERRORS
If you rerun the code, you will have to drop the table by uncommenting line 16 because the table will already exist, and therefore line 17, creating the table will fail.
